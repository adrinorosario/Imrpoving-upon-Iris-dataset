# Iris Classification

A Machine Learning project that classifies the [Iris flowers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(plant)) into their respective three species- [Setosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_setosa), [Versicolor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_versicolor) and [Virginica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_verginica).

The project uses Scikit Learn, a Python machine learning library, as well as Pandas for data analysis, Numpy for handling the arrays, Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualisation.

I have experimented with four algorithms to create models that classify the species accordingly through supervised learning:
K Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree and Stochastic Gradient Descent.
Each models have varied levels of accuracy.
